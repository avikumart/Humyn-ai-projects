Data science and machine learning projects from Humyn.ai challenges 

Challenge names:
1) **Project Puzzle:**

**Task: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand what patterns or trends influence project schedules and cost overruns.**

Running over cost or schedule in mining projects can have severe financial, operational, and reputational consequences, affecting a project's profitability, stakeholder confidence, and long-term sustainability. It is crucial for mining companies to effectively manage and control costs and adhere to project timelines to mitigate these risks.

We are looking for complex patterns in project management data which can help identify the factors influencing project scheduling and cost overruns. This will enable improved project planning and cost management in the long run.

Your analysis should explore and communicate the best way to curate the data to enable analytics. In your analysis, identify which factors most influence project delays and cost overruns.

2) **Rail Riddle:**

**Task Summary**
Perform exploratory data analysis to understand what patterns or trends influence rail delays.

**Question**
Are there patterns or influencing factors that could be used for improving rail planning accuracy, and ultimately to predict potential rail service level deviations?

**Background**
This data is from multiple mine sites, where multiple products are transported by rail to local customers as well as to a port for export to international customers.

At times the rail capacity and service levels may be negatively impacted. It is more important than ever to improve the accuracy of understanding of rail delays.

Typically the delays are related to the rail entity, on occasion these are also influenced by how fast the mines produce the ore material. The delay types are labeled in the data. Delays may also be seasonal, related to weather, or other seasonal events.
